Showcase Project

This project is basically a highlight of my skills in terms of design and implementation with javascript.

Main features would be a modern and sleek design, implementing various CSS techniques that provide a modern interaction with the application as well as Javascript incorporation of a custom gallery made from scratch.

I always find great pleasure in creating an application that is easy to use and has intuitive and modern design.
